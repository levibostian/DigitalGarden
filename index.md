I'm Levi.

I'm an indie app developer building and launching Android/iOS apps.

# App dev

I have been building mobile apps over 4 years and writing code since I was 13. I have built mobile apps for [Google](/archive/freelance/google) and [Salesforce](/archive/freelance/salesforce) as well as [a dozen startups around the country](/archive/freelance). I belong to the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Alpha and [Realm](https://realm.io/) MVP programs.

As someone with *wayyyyy* too many ideas and a freelancer working with multiple clients, my todo list is quite large. With that in mind, I have learned tools, libraries, techniques to write more code with less bugs.

To start, check out my highly rated tutorials on [how to build an Android library for Gradle](http://levibostian.com/blog/create-android-gradle-lib/) or [how to build an iOS library for Cocoapods](http://levibostian.com/blog/create-cocoapod/) so you can reuse your code across multiple projects. Or check out my favorite [Android](http://levibostian.com/blog/favorite-android-open-source-libs/) and [iOS](http://levibostian.com/blog/favorite-ios-open-source-libs/) open source libraries for mobile app developers.

# Founder

There is 1 thing I love as much as building apps. Launching them.

While in college, I worked for a startup for 2 years from 30 employees to when we got acquired. Through this experience, I found that the startup world is where I get excited. I started my first tech business at the age of 13 (by accident!) and ever since I have had at least 1 business going on at any given time.

Most recently, **I have the exciting news** of sharing that one of my products [got it's first customer](http://levibostian.com/blog/1-033-days-for-my-first-customer/)! This is exciting because I have only been working on this project for, you know, only 1,033 days. [Check out part 1 of my story on this project of mine](http://levibostian.com/blog/1-033-days-for-my-first-customer/).

What am I currently building?

I am building an Android and iOS app for a startup [HowFactory](/archive/freelance/howfactory), launching my app [Your Circle](/archive/products/your_circle) to the app stores, and building [online courses for indie Android/iOS devs](https://learn.levibostian.com/levelup_app_dev) to launch more apps with less bugs.
