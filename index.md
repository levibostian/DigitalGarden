I'm Levi. (he/him)

I love building new things and making positive change to the world every single day. 

During the day you will probably find me doing...

* Indie app developer building new businesses.
  * [Your Circle](https://findyourcircle.co/) - App I have been working the past few years on.

  * [Starting student software team building software for student startups](https://levibostian.com/blog/starting-new-software-team-for-students/). 
* [Building open source software](https://github.com/levibostian/). Most recently, the Teller ([iOS version](https://github.com/levibostian/Teller-iOS), [Android version](https://github.com/levibostian/Teller-Android)) and Wendy ([iOS version](https://github.com/levibostian/Wendy-iOS), [Android version](https://github.com/levibostian/Wendy-Android)) projects to help developers build offline-first mobile apps. 

When not working, you will probably find me doing...

* Running, rock climbing, disc golf, any kind of casual outdoor exercise to clear my mind. 
* Organic gardening - My partner and I are working hard to become fully self-sufficient and living off the land. 
* Reading - I have found an enjoyment in reading over the past couple of years. I strictly read non-fiction and tend to read about new topics I have interest in besides programming or business. 

My expertise...

* Freelancing 
* Software development (most specifically Android and iOS)
  * Automation
  * UX design for Android and iOS apps 
  * Kotlin, Java, Swift, Nodejs, Docker
* MVP development in the lean startup methodology 
* Productivity 
* Bootstrapping a startup 
* Remote work 

I believe in...

* Honesty and transparency. 
* Remote work. 
* Treating every living thing with respect and love, including our planet. We're all in this world together. 
* Veganism, minimalism, environmentalism.
* Every dollar is a vote. Spend your money with intention. 
* Work smarter, not harder (yes, startups and freelancers can work *just* 40 hrs a week).
