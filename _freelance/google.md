description: Built a prototype app for Google that never came to be.
location: California, USA

I briefly worked on this Google product for a couple of months in 2015. At the time, I was contracted with another developer to build and maintain 4 separate Android mobile apps with this project being one of them.

Unfortunately, this project never came to be even though it was finished.

**What I built:**

* Android native mobile app for prototype project.

## What does the app do?

The app was intended as a promotion for Android. It was built to be used as a display piece demonstrating Android. The mobile app was designed to run on 2+ Android devices, connect all together over a local WiFi connection, then communicate back and forth.

## Technically, what is impressive about the app?

* **I connected a handful of Android devices over a local network to communicate between one another.**
