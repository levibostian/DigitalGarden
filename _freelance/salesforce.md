In summer of 2015, I was contracted with another developer to consult and build prototypes for the [Salesforce Live product](https://www.salesforce.com/video/).

> Salesforce Live product today.

**What I built:**

* Native iOS prototype.
* Nodejs backend API to host the Salesforce Live content and deliver to users via mobile app.
* Development consulting.

## What does the app do?

[Salesforce Live](https://www.salesforce.com/video/) is an archive of [Dreamforce](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/) videos intended to learn about the Salesforce products. The developer I was contracted with and I consulted with a Salesforce team about the Salesforce Live product as well as built working prototypes for mobile app versions of Salesforce Live.
