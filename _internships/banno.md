While in college I worked for Banno a startup in Cedar Falls, Iowa. I built and maintained v1 and v2 of the Android native mobile apps with a team, became a senior level intern where I trained/mentored new employees and worked on production level code with senior engineers. I worked with Banno from when it went from ~30 employees to 60 and went through Banno's acquisition by Jack Henry and Associates.

**What I built:**

* Android native apps. v1 and v2 of the mobile app product.
* Senior level intern training/mentoring new employees.
* Android app tablet compatible.
