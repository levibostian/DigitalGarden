[Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) is an open source project that is near and dear to my heart. It is the first open source project that I made a pull request to and it was the first open source project (that I didn't create) that I became a member for to merge pull requests.

> [This](https://github.com/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs/pull/357) was my first pull request *ever*!

I was very active with the project a couple of years merging pull requests daily. This project brings up ~5 a day! I became (and still am) the third most contributed member of the project. Phew, it has been a lot of work to get to that point.

Lately, I have not been active with the project. Once I began taking on more and more projects with [Curiosity IO](https://curiosityio.com), I have not taken the time to work on the project. Great people behind that project. I highly recommend checking it out.
