Who am I?

I'm Levi. I'm a startup founder and Android/iOS app developer. I love building things.

**More about me:** I am born and raised in the Midwest of the United States (specifically Iowa). I am married to my best friend, a freelancer, an environmentalist, minimalist, and outdoors lover.

**More about my geeky side:** I am pretty obsessed with writing software. I have a hard time getting to bed at night because I think about writing code. I spend most of my time building native Android and iOS mobile app. Along with that, I also build APIs for my mobile apps using Nodejs. I used to be a web developer from age 13 to 20 when I then got involved with mobile app development. As of a year ago, I am getting back into web development with Vuejs, Pugjs, Tachyons CSS, Nodejs. My favorite programming language to use at this exact moment is Kotlin with Swift as a close second place.

**More about me as a startup founder:** I am a startup founder who is passionate about bootstrapping and launching products nice and lean. I find starting businesses this way to be very resourceful, efficient, and very fun from the challenge. I started my first business at the age of 13 by accident where I got talked into building a website for a small business in my hometown (at the time, I had never built a website before but I really wanted to learn). Ever since, I have always had at least 1 business going at any given moment. Currently, I am building SaaS products, mobile apps, and online courses for business products as well as my [freelancing services](https://curiosityio.com).

I am passionate about startups, building MVPs, bootstrapping, remote work, and many other topics.
