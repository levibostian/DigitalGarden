In high school, I operated a video game modification and repair service business. This was around the time that XBox 360 was getting popular and having issues with the [red ring of death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems) and I had a solution that fixed >95% of consoles I took in. I partnered with a local video game buy/sell/trade shop to attract business.

**What I serviced:**

* Fixed original Nintendo consoles that could not read games any longer.
* Fixed Playstation, PS2 consoles that could not read games any longer.
* Modified video game controllers with different color LED lights, buttons, joysticks.
* Repaired XBox 360 consoles with red ring of death.
* Purchased broken XBox 360 consoles, repaired, painted and installed LED lights and then resold for profit.
