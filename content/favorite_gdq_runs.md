title: Favorite GDQ runs
---

If you're a fan of [speedrunning](./speedrunning), you may have hard of the biggest speedrunning event out there, Games Done Quick (GDQ). GDQ is a week-long event that goes for 24 hours showing off some of the best speedrunning talent. But also, GDQ does showcase some non-speedrunning games to show off something really cool from a video game community that is guaranteed to blow your mind. 

Although the list of GDQ runs that I have enjoyed watching is much longer then this, these are the GDQ runs that I still have memories about. They are unique in some way making them memorable. 

Here is the list of my favorite GDQ runs. Enjoy. 

- [Kaizo Super Mario World relay race - SGDQ 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yARetgEZnEM) 

Kaizo Mario is brand new Mario games being created by the community using reverse engineered tools made by the community. Kaizo Mario is already technically impressive on it's own but this GDQ run showcased a Kaizo game built from scratch that made my jaw drop. The community added new enemies, new game items, new physics, and new sprites to Super Mario World just for this GDQ event. 

This is Super Mario World as you have never seen it before. The relay race and fact the runners have never seen the game before added fun to the game where everyone is learning the game on-the-fly making every jump a surprise to everyone. 

Also, I watched this one live in person and the full crowd in that room had tons of fun energy in it. 

- [Ocarina of Time TAS - SGDQ 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNbkv_DJ0f0)

This is arguably the most technically impressive thing that has ever been presented at GDQ. If you have nostalgia over Ocarina of Time or if you enjoy seeing things that are technologically impressive, this is a must watch. I still get goosebumps even just talking about this video. This is the video that you share with your friends who *do not* enjoy speedruns because it's that impressive. 

The TAS community did what I thought was not even possible with video games. That is all I will say to prevent spoilers. Give it your attention and enjoy. 

- [StepMania/NotITG by SpootyBiscuit - AGDQ 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBP8MxQhEVM)

If you enjoy Dance Dance Revolution or you want to see some amazing human talent, this run is impressive. 

StepMania is a community game that allows anyone to make DDR style maps to play. That alone is cool, but NotITG is a mod on top of StepMania that makes the difficulty beyond challenging. Not only are the NotITG maps really cool to on video, but watching the talent of SpootyBiscuit accomplish what looks to be is impossible is really fun. 

- [Twitch Plays Super Scribblenauts - AGDQ2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf2sNQ5t3Vo)

You may have heard of the concept of [Twitch Plays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon) which is where an online chat room plays a video game together. This is a version of that and is quite fun. According to the hosts of the run, they hooked up a mechanical robot with a Nintendo DS stylus that is able to take a string of text and it types the words into the DS's on-screen keyboard. 

Because the Scribblenauts game is fun on it's own, this video games advantage of that and involves the infamous Twitch chat. 

- [Link to the Past + Super Metroid Combo Randomizer by Andy and Ivan SGDQ2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uujsW7yFkZU)

Wait, what game is *Link to the Past + Super Metroid Combo*? If you have ever played either of these 2 games, you know that each of them have lots of doors in it. Well, the rom hacking community have been able to reverse engineer both of these video games and modify the games in many ways. They decided it would be fun to combine both of these games together into one game where when you go through a door in Link to the Past, you enter a random area of Super Metroid. You jump between each game every door that you enter. Your goal is to beat both games! 

To add to this, this modified game that combines 2 video games into 1 also has it's items randomized in it. So in order for you to beat both games, it requires lots of exploring and memorizing where items are through what doors. 

Fun fact, retro video game fans know about the small file size and other constraints that old video game consoles like the Super Nintendo have. Impressively, the rom hacking community who was able to combine these 2 video games together into 1 have gotten this modified game to install and execute on an original SNES cartridge playing on an original/unmodified SNES console!
