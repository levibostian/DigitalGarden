title: Favorite GDQ runs
---

If you're a fan of [speedrunning](./speedrunning), you may have hard of the biggest speedrunning event out there, Games Done Quick (GDQ). GDQ is a week-long event that goes for 24 hours showing off some of the best speedrunning talent. But also, GDQ does showcase some non-speedrunning games to show off something really cool from a video game community that is guaranteed to blow your mind. 

Here is the list of my top GDQ runs. Enjoy. 

- [Kaizo Super Mario World relay race - SGDQ 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yARetgEZnEM) 

**Who would like this?** If you want to see really challenging Mario mastered by Mario professionals, this is impressive. 

**Why is this one of my favorites?** Kaizo Mario is brand new Mario games being created by the community using reverse engineered tools made by the community. Kaizo Mario is already technically impressive on it's own but this GDQ run showcased a Kaizo game built from scratch that made my jaw drop. The community added new enemies, new game items, new physics, and new sprites to Super Mario World just for this GDQ event. 

Also, I watched this one live in person and the full crowd in that room had tons of fun energy in it. 

- [Ocarina of Time TAS - SGDQ 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNbkv_DJ0f0)

**Who would like this?** If you have nostalgia over Ocarina of Time or if you enjoy seeing things that are technologically impressive. This run will blow your mind, guaranteed. I still get goosebumps watching this multiple times. This speedrun is the run that you share with your friends who *do not* enjoy speedruns. 

**Why is this one of my favorites?** I don't even know where to start with this one. The TAS community did what I thought was impossible and would never be done. As someone who loves code and loves hacked old videos games, this is guaranteed to blow your mind. That is all I will say to prevent spoilers. Give it your attention and enjoy.
