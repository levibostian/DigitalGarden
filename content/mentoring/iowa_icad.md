Mentor for startups in the Iowa City area working with the ICAD group.

ICAD connects me to startups they feel I could impact the most with my technical and startup experience.

While working with these groups, they are usually at the place of needing help getting over hurdles. We talk about problems the teams are facing, I give pointers on how I have overcome similar experiences and we work through getting the team over hurdles along with other founders I may bring in to help.
