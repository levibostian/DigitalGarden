Volunteer my time each week to meet with startup teams to guide them to become better technical co-founders.

Customer discovery, User experience, gaining early traction, build MVP, bootstrapping, scaling are some of the topics I tend to cover most.

* Earmashin - Music discovery mobile app for upcoming artists to gain exposure.
* AssetRover - Saas software for real estate contractors to manage their portfolio.
* Streamweaver - Marketing firm for content creators. Twitch streamers, YouTubers.
* AMP'd Cycles - Building the next "smart bike".
