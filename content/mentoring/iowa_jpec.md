Mentor for student startup accelerator program.

I conduct weekly scheduled meetings with student teams to talk through progress. I push students to get out to market to learn in the real world instead of guessing. The best learning experience they can have is to learn by failure in the real world!

Through mentoring, student teams have moved on to raise over $20k+, find a business model and make sales, pivot to a new market, or invalidate their idea all before college graduation.
