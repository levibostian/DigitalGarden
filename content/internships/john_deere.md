description: Developed and maintained SQL .NET MVP web application for the maintenance department.

---

While in college I worked for John Deere drive train operations in Waterloo, Iowa. I developed and maintained SQL .NET MVP web application for the maintenance department.

In the drive train operations factory parts were developed, the maintenance department was in charge of making sure the machines were operating at full capacity. When the machines were down, the factory was less efficient. My job as the solo intern was to develop and maintain a web application that would collect statistics on what machines were breaking down the most and costing the department the most time and energy to keep up so those machines could be replaced.

**What I built:**

* SQL .NET MVP web application
* Solo intern in department
