I briefly worked on the AltspaceVR product for a couple of weeks in August of 2015. At the time, I was contracted with another developer to build and maintain 4 separate Android mobile apps.

**What I built:**

For AltspaceVR, I built the signup process in the Android mobile app.

## What is AltspaceVR?

AltspaceVR is a social network in virtual reality. Put on your headset and participate in social events with people all around the world. Hang out in space for fun, or attend a sponsored football game event.

## What does the app do?

The app allowed you to use a Samsung GearVR headset (I worked on the mobile app before Daydream launched) to attend AltspaceVR events. Login to the app, view the list of upcoming events, join an event from your phone using your Samsung GearVR headset.
