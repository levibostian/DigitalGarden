### Welcome! 

My name is Levi (they/them) and this is my personal site. It's my place on the Internet where I share my thoughts and about projects I am working on.

## "Live and learn"

That is one of my favorite quotes. I believe in living each day with joy and intention and to embrace failures. 

By day I am a software developer building Android & iOS mobile apps. When I am not working, I enjoy running, outdoor rock climbing, building stuff for my house, and urban gardening. 

In my life, I value...
* **Honesty and transparency**
* **Open source**: Sharing information with one another. We're all in this world together and we should help each other out while we are here. 
* **Small business**
* **Sustainability**
* **Equality**
* **Asynchronous and fully remote workplaces**
* **Internet privacy**

## I am a maker 

At my core, I am an engineer/maker/artist. In short, I build stuff. 

> Definition of engineer: A problem solver. Someone who enjoys finding problems and designing solutions to those problems. 

> Definition of maker: Someone who enjoys building things from scratch or modifying existing things. They build, test, and continuously improve upon what they build. 

I am a software developer specializing in Android & iOS mobile apps. Code is my tool I use to build digital products. I also enjoy wood working where I use wood to build physical products. 

In my engineering, I value...
* **Quality built for life**: As a minimalist and someone who cares deeply about sustainability, I try my best to buy and build products that will last a lifetime. 
* **Products built for humans**: We see products (especially software) that are made for robots. As engineers and designers, lets not forget who we are creating for. 
* **Design that doesn't require a manual or tutorial**: I believe that products have a great design when they do not require a tutorial or a manual to learn. I try to build products that are understood at first glance. 

## I ‚ô•Ô∏è üåè

I am an environmental activist fighting for the sustainability of our home, planet Earth. 

To be more sustainable, I...
* **Power my home with solar**
* **Grow almost all of my produce I eat year-round**
* **Preserve foods to last in the cold winter climate**
* **Take part in political action to fight climate change**
* **Work on DIY house projects to make our home more sustainable**: Solar power, restoring our grass lawn into native prairie flowers/grass, reduce water run-off into our city sewer system.
