## What is Your Circle?

[Your Circle](http://findyourcircle.co) is a virtual support group mobile app for patients and their families. Currently launched with cancer patients and their families, Your Circle aims to provide emotional support to all who are struggling in life.

Your Circle started as a [Startup Weekend project](http://levibostian.com/blog/startup-weekend-iowa-city-2014-the-greatest-weekend-of-2014/), my first job out of college, and now a business helping cancer patients and their families.

## What does the app do?

Your Circle is a virtual support group mobile app that allows patients and their family members to get matched, by hand, to others who can relate with their life struggle. Users who are matched together can chat together to build relationships together and help each other emotionally.

Your Circle is built in a generic way so that it can launch to all different industries within minutes. Currently, it is serving those affected by cancer. If you belong to an emotional support non-profit and would like to see how Your Circle can help you with your mission, please contact myself by [phone](tel:+18445516607) or [email](mailto:levi@findyourcircle.co) and we can talk about it.

## Technically, what is impressive about the app?

* **Onboarding process is all done via chat**

I do not believe in tutorials for software. Hopefully, your software is not difficult enough to figure out it requires a tutorial. With that in mind, the entire onboarding experience with Your Circle is done via chat:

* **White labeled mobile app**

Your Circle is designed to be your own. As a non-profit working with Your Circle, you may choose to have your patients use the Your Circle branded mobile app or have your very own version of the mobile app launched for you.

* **Physical medium added to digital product**

To keep this app safe, I have designed and developed a way to keep Your Circle safe from strangers creating an account and interacting with users. I print out Access Cards (essentially business cards) with a one-time unique code written on each one. I then hand those cards to the non-profits that work with me who then distribute them to the patients they work with. It is assumed that if you have an access card, you obtained it from safe hands from myself to the patient.
