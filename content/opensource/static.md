# Static

### Where did Static come from?

I have been using the blogging platform [Ghost](https://ghost.org) for a few years now. Sure, I could have used Blogger or Tumblr back then but Ghost appealed to me for many reasons. One reason was that you can self-host Ghost on your own server.

At the time, I didn't feel like setting up and paying for a web server to host my blog that had zero blog posts on it at the time. It was not worth it for me. I was using GitHub pages for all of my website hosting. I wanted a way to still use the Ghost platform but be able to host my blog on GitHub pages.

I began googling ways to generate a static version of a Ghost blog. I searched near and far to try and find a solution with no luck. I wanted something simple, something that was flexible, something that would not break my site and was easy to deploy. Then, I found this open source project [buster](https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster). Buster is built for this purpose of generating a static version of a Ghost blog. I was so happy to find this! Only problem, it didn't work for me?!

I forked the original project and built a github project called better-buster (yeah, great name I know) which simply fixed the buster code base for me the way I needed.

After building better-buster, I thought to myself, all that this project does is allows you to simply preview, download, and deploy dynamic sites to GitHub pages. That is all it does. It is not built *just* for Ghost. Why not open it up? That is where Static was born.
