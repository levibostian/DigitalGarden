# Build

The site uses Jekyll. You need to do a couple of steps to get the site to build. 

* `npm install` # Install dependencies. 
* `bundle` # Get jekyll plugins
* `gulp` # To build the tachyons SCSS file for me since Jekyll cannot read it from the regular directory structure tachyons comes in via npm.
