The name Curiosity IO came from my desire to build new things. I wanted a company name that did not have a location tied to it so I could take it wherever I am in life. I didn't want my name added to it in case it becomes more then me some day. I didn't want to tag on "freelance", "mobile" keywords to it so I can build products beyond mobile apps. Curiosity IO is my place to be curious. My entity I can release new products on and see what happens.

All of the projects listed on my [freelance page](/archive/freelance) as well as my [products](/archive/products) page are all created under Curiosity IO.

Curiosity IO is where I learn. It's where I grow. I want to experiment with advertisements, project management, crowd funding, teaching, content creation all to learn from. Curiosity IO is what I use to make that happen.
