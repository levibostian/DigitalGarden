# What projects am I working on?

* [Freelance] Finishing up an Android app for competitive people to keep a history of their played games. *(Beta coming out shortly!)*

* [Freelance] Shipping some awesome new features to the [FanBlitz iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fanblitz/id1304367261?mt=8). View a list of suggested people to invite to the app and add as friends quickly. 

* [Teaching] Hiring and onboarding 4 students for the [Founder's Club software team](https://www.iowajpec.org/foundersclub). These 4 students are outstanding and I cannot wait to begin working with them. They each bring unique qualities to help us all grow, together. 

* [Life] I am insulating the attic in my home. I am super, super tired and stressed about it, but just about done. 

# Announcements? 

* [Teller](https://github.com/levibostian/Teller-Android), for Android, has become a project I am quite proud of. It crosses off all of the checkboxes for, "What makes a good GitHub project?" I have been using it in my apps in production and am really loving it. Nice API, easy to work with, great testing support. [Check out the new documentation website](https://levibostian.github.io/Teller-Android/#/) to learn more. 

# What is going really well right now?

* The past couple of weeks I have not checked any social media. Well, I do still use YouTube, but I have not checked any *timelines* in social media. This is going well because I have not missed it and have felt better in a few ways. 

* I have been shipping code fast lately. I have felt much more focused at work lately (maybe because no social media?, not sure) and have been able to get more code written, faster. 

# What is going not-so-well right now? 

* I continue to struggle with finding the right time in my day to write. I have drafts of content done, ready to edit and publish, but I have not done it. Not sure how to fix this? 

* Because of the attic project, I have made exercise a lower priority. This is the longest break from running I have made in 2 years and I miss it. 

# Experiments I am trying 

* Eating 2 meals a day with no snacking. After reading a book on running and talking with a friend of mine lately about how often we eat each day, a month ago I started this experiment. I eat breakfast at 10:30am, then either dinner at 4pm or a small lunch at 3 and a smaller dinner at 6pm. Not much to say here yet, but I feel I have less cravings and snacking habits anymore.
