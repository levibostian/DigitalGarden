Mentor for student startup accelerator program.

I conduct weekly scheduled meetings with student teams to talk through progress. I push students to get out to market to learn in the real world instead of guessing. The best learning experience they can have is to learn by failure in the real world!

Through mentoring, student teams have moved on to raise over $20k+, find a business model and make sales, pivot to a new market, or invalidate their idea all before college graduation.

I have worked with startups:

* Atlas Capital - personal finance chatbot for millennials.
* Empowered - Support network for those going through tough life experiences.
* Stonefruit Coffee Co. - Coffee company for the outdoors person.
* ABAL - Mobile app for autism patients to perform ABA therapy.
* Comigo - Find projects on your college campus to collaborate on. 
* Eco-Stylist - Find and purchase eco friendly clothing for men. 

...I cannot think of the dozens more startups I have worked with through various other JPEC programs. These are the most recent. The JPEC student group is *so much fun* working with!
